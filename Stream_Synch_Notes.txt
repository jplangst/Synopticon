(Synopticon)
* Ask who is part of this recording (Publish recording event "AnnounceRecordingParticipants")
    * Listen for announcing events for 5seconds ("Synopticon.RecordingSyncEvents", type participantid)
        * Store id of the senders in a list
* Send a record request (Publish recording event "StartRecording")
    * Listen for recording started events ("Synopticon.RecordingSyncEvents", type readytorecord)
        *Once all registered participants have said they are ready
            *Send a StartTimestamp event (Publish recording event "SetStartTimestamp")
            *Also use this timsestamp for our own stream.
            
Once the recordings are done we can then synchronize by cutting everything recorded 
before the "Start Timestamp" was set. Then we find the recording with the shortest duration and use
that time as the end of the recordings. Cut anything after that time from the recordings. 
This will result in a set of recordings with MS difference in the starting of their recording that has 
the same duration. 

If even better accuracy is required for the synch you will have to come up with a solution yourselves.
